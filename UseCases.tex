\subsection{Event-List Data and Responses}


\subsubsection{Use Case --- Search for event lists surrounding Sgr A* for morphological studies}

{\em Identify all HEA event lists encompassing Sgr~A* for initial selection for subsequent morphological studies.  Since a large number (at least several hundred) of observations are expected to match this request and the focus is on morphological studies, only the event lists and not the event bundles are desired.\/}

\medskip
\noindent Find all datasets satisfying:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item Target name = ``Sgr A*'' or position inside 30 arcmin from (266.4168, $-29.0078$).
  \item dataproduct\_type = ``event-list''.

AND (dataproduct_type EQ `event-list')
\end{verbatim}


\subsubsection{Use Case --- Search for event bundles that include Cas A for spectrophotometric evolution studies}

{\em Identify all event bundles that include the Cas A SNR and have at least 1 million events for subsequent spectrophotometric studies of the SNR expansion.  Since only a few observations are expected to match this request and because the focus is on spectrophotometric studies, the event bundles that include the responses or the ancillary products used to make the responses are required.\/}

\medskip
\noindent Find all datasets satisfying:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item Target name = ``Cas A'' or position inside 10 arcmin from (350.8584, $+58.8113$).

\subsubsection{Use Case --- Identify PSF response-functions for further analysis of previously downloaded data products}

{\em Identify all Chandra Source Catalog point spread functions for source detections that fall within 2 arcmin radius of  (83.84358, $-5.43639$) in the Orion star-forming complex for Chandra observation 4374.  These PSFs will be used to analyze previously downloadedcatalog data products for the same field.\/ }

\subsubsection{Use Case --- Search for event lists that include a fully calibrated spectral axis for BL Lac for rapid spectrophotometric evaluation}

{\em Identify all event lists that include the BL Lac, have a fully calibrated spectral axis (i.e., spectral responses have already been applied), and have at least 10,000 events.  These data will be used to prepare slides for a presentation.  Note that since calib\_status = 2 may not specify that the spectral axis is fully calibrated in physical units (HEA event lists are often considered ``calibrated'' even if the spectral axis is in pulse height units ) the calibration status of the spectral axis must be checked explicitly.\/}

\subsubsection{Use Case --- Search for spatially resolved spectropolarimetric observation of the Crab with spectral resolution R > 100}

{\em Identify all event bundles for observations of the Crab that intersect the 1.0--100.0 keV energy range, have calibrated spatial and time axes, are spatially resolved in 2 dimensions in equatorial coordinates, have spectral resolution $R>100$, and include polarimetry measurements.  Note that ObsCore specifies that the axes lengths --- s\_xel1, s\_xel2, em\_xel, t\_xel, pol\_xel --- should be set to $-1$ for non-pixelated data like event lists, so these quantities are not useful for this query.\/}
