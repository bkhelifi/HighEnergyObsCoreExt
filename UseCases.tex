\subsection{Event-List Data and Responses}


\subsubsection{Use Case --- Search for event lists surrounding Sgr A*, for exemple for an X-ray morphological study}

{\em Identify all \gls{HE} event lists encompassing Sgr~A* for initial selection for subsequent X-ray morphological studies.  Since the focus is on X-ray morphological studies, only the event lists and not the event bundles are desired.\/}

\medskip
\noindent Find all datasets satisfying:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item Target name = ``Sgr A*'' or position inside 30 arcmin from (266.4168, $-29.0078$)

\end{verbatim}


\subsubsection{Use Case --- Search for event bundles that include Cas A for X-ray spectrophotometric evolution studies}

{\em Identify all event bundles that include the Cas A SNR and have at least 1 million events for subsequent spectrophotometric studies of the SNR expansion. Since only a few observations are expected to match this request and because the focus is on X-ray spectrophotometric studies, the event bundles that include the responses or the ancillary products used to make the responses are required.\/}

\medskip
\noindent Find all datasets satisfying:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item Target name = ``Cas A'' or position inside 10 arcmin from (350.8584, $+58.8113$)
  \item dataproduct\_type = ``event-bundle''
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Use Case --- Search for event bundles via DataLink that include Cas A for a TeV spectromorphology study}

{\em Identify all event lists and their associated \glspl{IRF} that include the Cas A SNR for subsequent TeV spectromorphology studies from a VERITAS data release. Since the instrumental responses are mandatory to remove instrumetal effects, the event bundles that include the  \glspl{IRF} are required.\/}

\medskip
\noindent Find all VERITAS datasets satisfying:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item Target name = ``Cas A'' or position inside 4 deg from (350.8584, $+58.8113$)
  \item dataproduct\_type = ``event-bundle''
  \item obs\_collection = ``VERITAS-DR1''

AND (dataproduct_type = 'event-bundle')
AND (obs_collection = 'VERITAS-DR1')
AND (access_format = ’application/x-votable+xml;content=datalink’)
\end{verbatim}

Then, for each row of the output, we get the ``access\_url'' of the DataLink and access to the data.

\subsubsection{Use Case --- Identify PSF response-functions for further analysis of previously downloaded data products}

{\em Identify all Chandra Source Catalog point spread functions for source detections that fall within 2 arcmin radius of  (83.84358, $-5.43639$) in the Orion star-forming complex for Chandra observation 4374.

\subsubsection{Use Case --- Get all the \glspl{IRF} for a given CTAO observation, for simulation purposes}

\end{verbatim}


\subsubsection{Use Case --- Search for event lists that include a fully calibrated spectral axis for BL Lac for rapid X-ray spectrophotometric evaluation}

{\em Identify all event lists that include the BL Lac, have a fully calibrated spectral axis (i.e., spectral responses have already been applied), and have at least 10,000 events.  These data will be used to prepare slides for a presentation.  Note that since calib\_status = 2 may not specify that the spectral axis is fully calibrated in physical units (HEA event lists are often considered ``calibrated'' even if the spectral axis is in pulse height units ) the calibration status of the spectral axis must be checked explicitly.\/}

\medskip

{\em Identify all event bundles for observations of the Crab that intersect the 1.0--100.0 keV energy range, have calibrated spatial and time axes, are spatially resolved in 2 dimensions in equatorial coordinates, have spectral resolution $R>100$, and include polarimetry measurements.  Note that ObsCore specifies that the axes lengths --- s\_xel1, s\_xel2, em\_xel, t\_xel, pol\_xel --- should be set to $-1$ for non-pixelated data like event lists, so these quantities are not useful for this query.\/}

\medskip
\noindent Find all datasets satisfying:
